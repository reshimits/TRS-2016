I order on like the 25th of March and didn't receive my order until like the 6 of May that is the only bad thing I have to say about them and I understand that it happens and you gotta roll with the punches. After my install I love the quality and look of the product. Will definitely buy again for my next vehicle. Thanks!”</h6>

It's like driving around with the factory high beams on. One thing that does bother me is that the cutoff does gradually slope off to each side. Nothing drastic though. My other complaint, and only a minor one is that the mount for the bulb holder was slightly off so the bracket had to be bent to be able to put all three screws in. The cutoff is as crisp as every other projector car I've parked next to but my alignment is slightly off. For the price and the improvement over factory, this can't be beaten and the quality of build is top notch.”</h6>

                                        <h6 class="">“So far, not so good. June 14th I order a retrofit kit for my Subie. Order acknowledgment states a high beam splitter cord is on back order. Fine, thats cool. So I call a couple days later just to check up, also thinking maybe they could just ship the kit without for now, I'll even pay shipping separately, so I can get install rolling, after all, splitter cord should just plug in later anyway. But I am assured that they expect them next week. Cool. I'll just wait for it all. That goes by, nothing. So I call about two weeks after ordering now. Now its not the splitter cord, its the retro quik bracket. Okaayy. So should have them after the fourth weekend. Alright. In the meantime, I get the July 1 email ad screaming out all the deals, like the 25 percent off I could have gotten on my kit, although they already ran my card quite awhile back and I ordered two weeks before. Also couldn't miss the line in the ad about "guaranteed availability in stock for just 24 hours", except that couldn't be right if I'm understanding correctly, because that would mean they have what I'm waiting for, right? Made me a bit sour. Perfection is not the issue here. Its hyping the product and the service and not delivering. At least the service at this point, not that whoever I've talked to hasn't been friendly and polite, but it seems a bit like I'm just getting a line to keep me on the hook. I have not received any communciation from them at all since my confirmation email, it has all been one way. I'm holding out because the products have great support and reviews and I've done my research. I hope that turns out to be the case whenever I do get my kit, unfortunately it doesn't look likely in time for the two week road trip I hoped to have it for. I will update this review whenever it all shakes out.”</h6>
