Due to the high volume of incoming and outgoing packages each day, if the provided RMA number is not clearly marked on the outside of the box it may be refused. The RMA number for this process is provided in the order screen of your TRS account page. Please allow 2-3 business days for your RMA request to be reviewed. We are not responsible for return postage unless the return is required due to our mistake, in which case we will send a pre-paid shipping label. </p>
                                    <p>Due to the nature of our products, TRS does not accept returns on custom parts (lens etching, projector tuning service, etc.), un-sealed HID bulbs, or any items in our Closeouts section. Our standard restocking fee structure is outlined below. Please refer to our exchange and refund policies immediately below for important timelines.</p>
                                    <p>Tier 1: Perfect condition. (Unopened &amp; like-new) = 90% refund or 100% store credit. <br> 
                                    Tier 2: Re-conditionable. (Packaging opened or damaged) = 80% refund or 90% store credit.<br>        
                                    Tier 3: Inability to restock. (Product &amp; packaging both damaged) = 70% refund or 80% store credit. </p>

                                    <p>Parts may be exchanged if they are in like-new condition with their original unopened packaging for credit towards anything else in-stock. Please note: no products from our "Closeouts" section can be exchanged. Exchanges must be made within 60 days of the original purchase date. For example, you ordered projector "X" but changed your mind and now want to use projector "Y". If your returned part(s) cannot be restocked as "new" we reserve to right to deny the exchange or apply only a partial credit towards your new items (no more than 20% reduction in value.) If you need to make a rushed exchange, you can order the new part first and then return the original for a refund without being subject to any restocking fees on the “exchanged” item.  The RMA number for this process is provided in the order screen of your TRS account page. Please allow two business days for your RMA request to be reviewed. </p>

Due to the high volume of orders that ship each day, there is a only a 15 minute window from the time your order is submitted until the time our automated order processing system generates a shipping label in our adjacent fulfilment warehouse for picking and shipping. Once your order status is "Processing" - it can no longer be changed or cancelled. Please beware that due to the short window of time between submission and procesing, we can only guarantee cancellation reqests if they are called in immediately after the order is placed. Once an order has left the building, shipping costs are non-refundable. Special Orders cannot be cancelled; they are placed based your commitment to the purchase. </p>

Once we have clearly identified which component failed; you will not have to return it to us for a replacement. You will be asked to send in an image with the wires on the part cut and the serial number visible. A new part will be issued, generally within 1-3 business days. We will replace dead bulbs alone if the purchase was one year or less from the time of failure. If the bulbs are still under warranty and it has been more than a full year, we will replace the pair. In special cases, we won't require you to permanently disable the part before a replacement is sent (ie if a light bulb is mis-colored but still working). OEM Parts must be returned for warranty service. Morimoto brand parts can be warrantied without return. If an item is discontinued by the manufacture; it's warranty is not void, but the part will be replaced with the current equivalent of the same product. No refunds or credit will be issued in lieu of replacements. </p>

If you would like your package insured for its full value, you must add shipping insurance on the shipping option screen during checkout. With insurance, you will be covered against damage, loss, or any delivery related issues. If no insurance is added and you selected UPS shipping, you will only be covered for $100. If no insurance is added and you selected USPS shipping, unfortunately we won't be able to guarantee any kind of resolution.
